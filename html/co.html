<h1>Carbon Monoxide</h1>

Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless and poisonous gas that comes from burning things like kerosene, coal, or wood. Breathing air containing only a very small amount of carbon monoxide can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood. If you breathe in carbon monoxide, you may develop symptoms like a flu or a cold, experience blurred vision, sleepiness, ringing in the ears and breathing difficulties, or get stomachaches.
